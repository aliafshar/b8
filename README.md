# bominade (b8)

**Vim-based IDE**

Bominade is the successor to a8 and PIDA. It is an extremely light-weight IDE
based on NeoVim, a file browser and a terminal emulator. It is currently in
heavy development but I use it every day.

For all information, check out the website at [bominade.dev](https://bominade.dev)
